# cv

My own CV PDF generator.
This is written in Latex.

## Get started

- Clone this repo

- Run `npm ci`

## Compile

- Run `npm run compile`

## Work on it

It is possible to have the PDF compiled each time any changes are made. To do so, just run:

```bash
npm run watch
```

This will compile the PDF, open the PDF and watch for changes in any file inside the `src` folder. When such changes are made, the PDF will be compiled again.
