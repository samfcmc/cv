Everything started since the first time I saw a computer when I was a kid (around 8 or 9 years old). 
I was curious about it and started to explore what I could do with it. Since then, 
I became obsessed with technology and wanted to know even more.
Now, I love coding because it is challenging and it allows me to build real solutions 
for real problems with just my fingertips :)
